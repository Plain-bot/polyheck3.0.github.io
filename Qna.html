            <h1>Questions that you might have</h1>
            <hr> <!--funny line-->

            <!--First question-->
            <h3>Whats PolyHeck?</h3>
            <p>Its explained in the <a href="https://plainsys.github.io/polyheck3.0.github.io/">Home</a> tab :/</p>

            <!--Second question-->
            <h3>Will this be ported to other devices?</h3>
            <p>Mac will be released first, then Windows as 3.0 and Browsers (known as PolyHeck Chrome). Other then that, no not really.</p>

            <!--Third Question-->
            <h3>Will it use the old sprites?</h3>
            <p>Aside from a few, no, everything will be remade from the ground up.</p>

            <!--Fourth question-->
            <h3>Why is this being remade again???</h3>
            <p>Well main purpose is for Mac build. Other reason is because 2.0 was VERY poorly coded. So im trying again.</p>
            
            <!--Fifth question-->
            <h3>Where will this be downloaded?</h3>
            <p>Probably here but it will also be released in the "releases" tab for the open sourced repository if I figure out how to do that. Also web version will be released on 
                <a href="https://plainsys.github.io/">The Trash Ting</a> and maybe <a href="https://github.com/dudenoob34">DudeNoob's</a> <a href="https://dudenoob34.github.io/dudes-game-hub/">Dude Hub</a>
            </p>

            <!--Sixth question-->
            <h3>Can I host this on my site?</h3>
            <p>Sure as long as its YOU'RE OWN website (not something like Itch.io or gotm.io) and you provide credit.</p>
            
            <!--Seventh question-->
            <h3>Will it have mod support?</h3>
            <p>I plan on making this open source so theoritcally yes, I might also add custom level thing.</p>
