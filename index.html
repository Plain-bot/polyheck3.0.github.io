        <p>AAAAH - Welcome to the PolyHeck (3.0) Website. As you probably already know, this site contains info on upcoming game i'm making called PolyHeck... 3.0</p>
        <br>
        <h1>What the hell is a PolyHeck?</h1>
        <p>PolyHeck is a game made by a dumb kid (me... Plain) back in 2018 because he was bored. The game got revived in 2020 (1.0) for online browsers made using Wick Editor.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The game was kinda shit though so, I remade it back in the summer of 2021 alongside PolyHeck 2. Since then the game was like that until I thought of remaking it again but this
            time for Mac, Although it will get ported to Windows where it will be known as PolyHeck 3.0.
