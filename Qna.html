        <h1>Questions that you might have</h1>
        <hr>
        <h3>Whats PolyHeck?</h3>
        <p>Its explained in the <a href="index.html">Home</a> tab :/</p>
        <h3>Will this be ported to other devices?</h3>
        <p>Mac will be released first, then Windows as 3.0 and Browsers (known as PolyHeck Chrome). Other then that, no not really.</p>
        <h3>Will it use the old sprites?</h3>
        <p>Aside from a few, no, everything will be remade from the ground up.</p>
        <h3>Why is this being remade again???</h3>
        <p>Well main purpose is for Mac build. Other reason is because 2.0 was VERY poorly coded. So im trying again.</p>
        <h3>Where will this be downloaded?</h3>
        <p>Probably here but it will also be released in the "releases" tab for the open sourced repository if I figure out how to do that. Also web version will be released on 
            <a href="https://plainsys.github.io/">The Trash Ting</a> and maybe <a href="https://github.com/dudenoob34">DudeNoob's</a> <a href="https://dudenoob34.github.io/dude-hub/">Dude Hub</a>
